# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Planning decisions are multi-model verified by structural enforcement, not instruction-following
**Current focus:** Phase v0.30-01: Dynamic Model Selection

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Dynamic Model Selection)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase (3 plans in 2 waves)
Status: Executing — plan 02 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-07 - Completed v0.30-01-02 Token Dashboard (2 tasks, 14 tests passing)

Progress: [###.......] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v0.30-01 | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min
- Trend: Starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure ordered by dependency depth and blast radius -- cost control first, parallelization last
- [Roadmap]: VERF-01 (file-based state) separated into its own phase as foundation for both memory (Phase 3) and verification (Phase 5)
- [Research]: Zero new npm dependencies -- all patterns build on Node.js built-ins and existing infrastructure
- [v0.30-01-02]: Hardcoded cost table instead of live pricing to maintain zero-dependency constraint
- [v0.30-01-02]: Copilot displays 'subscription' instead of '$0.00' to avoid user confusion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 6 (Subagent Orchestration) and Phase 7 (Parallelization) as needing deeper research during planning
- additionalContext token budget contention: multiple injection sources (quorum + memory + verification) must share ~4000 token ceiling
