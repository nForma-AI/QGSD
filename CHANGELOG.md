# Changelog

All notable changes to nForma will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Six human phase skills ship with nForma: `nf:idea`, `nf:plan`, `nf:build`, `nf:ship`, `nf:debug`, `nf:observe` — each `SKILL.md` documents sub-skills, commands, entry/exit conditions, and routing across the full development lifecycle (closes #94)
- Adversarial test coverage for aggregate-requirements, continuous-verify, oscillation-detector, and solve-cycle-detector modules (`bin/*-adversarial.test.cjs`)
- `bin/resolve-formal-tools.test.cjs` — new test suite for formal tool resolution

### Fixed
- `fix(set-secret)`: restore Usage message when stdin value is missing
- `fix(continuous-verify)`: correctness bugs surfaced during adversarial testing
- `fix(solve-cycle-detector)`: edge-case fixes found during adversarial testing
- `fix(secrets)`: hardening identified during adversarial test runs

## [0.42.3] - 2026-04-11 — Repowise Intelligence Integration (v0.42 milestone)

### Added
- `feat(solve)`: Add real impact tracking to solve skill — reports lead with bugs_fixed, tests_added, docs_fixed, dead_code_removed summary computed from git diff excluding .planning directory
- `feat(solve)`: Remediation dispatches now classified as real_fix, true_positive_closure, fp_suppression, or reclassification
- `feat(solve)`: Remediation sub-skill runs npm run test:ci and npm run lint:isolation after waves, dispatching /nf:quick fixes for any new failures
- `feat(solve)`: solve-state.json tracks real_impact per iteration

### Fixed
- `fix(test)`: River ML statusline tests (TC15/16/19/21/22/23) now mock `HOME` with a fake `nf-python-env/bin/python` — these tests passed locally (where `~/.claude/nf-python-env` exists) but failed in CI where the runner has no python env, causing the River indicator gate to skip the state file check entirely

## [0.42.1-rc.1] - 2026-04-10 — coderlm operational hardening

### Fixed
- `fix(coderlm)`: circuit-breaker in `sweepGitHeatmap` stops querying after 3 consecutive `getCallersSync` failures — prevents 5 s timeout × N-files overhead when server is unresponsive
- `fix(coderlm)`: pre-flight `healthSync()` before first sweep emits availability to stderr so fail-open status is visible before queries start
- `fix(coderlm)`: CDIAG-03 wired into solve loop — in `--skip-layers` incremental mode, call-graph expansion via `computeAffectedLayers` un-skips layers whose transitive callers were affected by remediation

## [0.42.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-10 — Deep coderlm Solve Integration

### Added
- `feat(repowise)`: XML context packing — `escape-xml.cjs`, `pack-file.cjs`, `context-packer.cjs` deliver file contents in `<file path="...">...</file>` XML format with proper escaping (PACK-01, PACK-02, PACK-03)
- `feat(repowise)`: Hotspot detection — `hotspot.cjs` computes per-file churn×complexity risk scores from git log with streaming parsing, mass-refactor weighting, and noise filtering (HOT-01, HOT-03, HOT-04)
- `feat(repowise)`: AST-based cyclomatic complexity — `computeAstComplexity()` uses skeleton.cjs tree-sitter AST parsing for per-file complexity, with line-count heuristic fallback; `computeHotspotsAst()` async variant and `--use-ast-complexity` CLI flag (HOT-02)
- `feat(repowise)`: Quorum escalation from hotspots — `resolve-hotspot-risk.cjs` + nf-prompt.js HOT-05 automatically escalate quorum fan-out for high-risk files (HOT-05)
- `feat(repowise)`: Co-change prediction — `cochange.cjs` mines file co-occurrence pairs from git history with temporal coupling scoring and inverse file-count weighting; `inject-cochange-debug.cjs` surfaces partners in debug context (COCH-01, COCH-02, COCH-03, COCH-04)
- `feat(repowise)`: Skeleton views — `skeleton.cjs` extracts structural code views via web-tree-sitter WASM (lazy init) with regex fallback; enriches entries with hotspot risk and coupling degree (SKEL-01, SKEL-02, SKEL-03, SKEL-04)
- `feat(repowise)`: Budget-aware compression — `budget-compressor.cjs` adapts context detail level to token budget with risk-weighted allocation; `--budget=N` flag in context-packer (PACK-04)
- `feat(context-retriever)`: `repowise` domain added to context-retriever — hotspot-cache.json, cochange-cache.json, and repowise keyword detection
- `feat(task-classifier)`: `adjustForHotspotRisk()` reads hotspot cache to escalate task complexity when touching high-risk files (simple→moderate at score >0.4, →complex at >0.7)
- `feat(workflows)`: Context-packer wired into plan-phase.md (step 4.7), quick.md (step 2.75), debug.md (step A.3) with fail-open pattern
- `feat(hotspot)`: `loadHeatmapChurn()` reuses git-heatmap.json churn ranking data instead of re-parsing git log

### Changed
- `refactor(repowise)`: hotspot.cjs now tries heatmap cache data first before git log reparse, merging existing git-heatmap.cjs signals

## [0.41.18] - 2026-04-09 — River ML Q-learning and tech debt standardization

### Added
- `feat(routing)`: River ML Q-learning replaces the bandit policy — `routing-policy.cjs` now uses `QLearning` with ε-greedy exploration, learning rate 0.1, discount 0.9, and a reward signal wired into Mode C dispatch on task completion (#73)
- `feat(statusline)`: River ML phase indicator in `nf-statusline.js` — shows current routing policy phase (exploration / exploitation / shadow) with live shadow-mode recommendations surfaced from the learning loop state file
- `feat(quick-384-386)`: E2E learning loop test (`quick-386`) validates the full River ML cycle: dispatch → reward recording → Q-table update → shadow recommendation persistence
- `feat(verify-work)`: framework-native tests (Playwright first, Jest fallback) now auto-discovered and run via `maintain-tests run-batch` before UAT prompt — UAT completes automatically when all pass
- `docs(issue-77)`: 10 technical debt items (DEBT-07–DEBT-16) formalized as tracked requirements in `requirements.json` — covering JSON serialization patterns, path resolution, empty catch blocks, 4 formal model gaps, and the audit process itself

### Changed
- `refactor(routing)`: `quorum-slot-dispatch.cjs` records routing reward after each Mode C dispatch result — success/failure/partial mapped to +1/−0.5/+0.25

## [0.41.17] - 2026-04-08 — Config-driven milestones

### Added
- `feat(config)`: `default_milestone` field in `.planning/config.json` allows projects to specify a milestone without requiring STATE.md or ROADMAP.md — enables milestone workflows in early-stage projects (#64)
- 10 tests covering all `default_milestone` code paths: config parsing, format normalization, priority ordering, "auto" bypass, empty string fallback, and `phase-plan-index` population
- Requirement CONF-10 elevated to formal requirements

### Fixed
- `fix(gsd-tools)`: `cmdInitQuick()` now populates `chosen_milestone` and `default_milestone_used` fields (were declared but never set)

## [0.41.16] - 2026-04-07 — The skills gap is now a skills overlap

### Added
- Six packaged skills ship with nForma out of the box: `nf:task-intake`, `nf:idea-refine`, `nf:code-review-and-quality`, `nf:security-and-hardening`, `nf:documentation-and-adrs`, and `nf:shipping-and-launch` — best practices from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills), now fluent in nForma's workflow language
- Checklist registry (`core/references/checklist-registry.json`) + `bin/checklist-match.cjs` — type a task description, get the right checklist back, no manual routing required
- Upstream guidance gaps closed: accessibility, API design, performance, security, TDD, testing patterns, verification patterns, and git integration checklists all now speak to nForma-specific concerns

### Changed
- Packaged skill commands trimmed to the essential six; removed skills' guidance folded into core workflow references so nothing is lost, just better placed
- Checklist routing in `nf:quick` now driven by the registry instead of hardcoded conditions

## [0.41.15] - 2026-04-07 — Automatic test reuse in verify-work

### Added
- `feat(verify-work)`: `present_test` step now auto-discovers and runs framework-native tests (Playwright first, Jest fallback) via `maintain-tests discover` + `maintain-tests run-batch` before presenting to user — UAT completes automatically when all discovered tests pass, falls back to manual checkpoint when tests fail or no tests are found

## [0.41.14] - 2026-04-06 — Dist-tag alignment automation

### Fixed
- `fix(ci)`: `release.yml` now auto-aligns `@next` dist-tag to match `@latest` after every stable publish — ensures `next` never falls behind `latest`
- `fix(publish)`: `publish.sh` (manual publish) also aligns `@next` after stable publish and prints dist-tag summary

### Changed
- `docs(CLAUDE.md)`: add dist-tag invariant rule — `next` must never fall behind `latest`, with verification command
- `docs(prepare-release.sh)`: PR body and post-merge instructions now mention `@next` alignment step
- `docs(release.sh)`: post-release instructions now mention dist-tag verification

## [0.41.13] - 2026-04-06 — Formal verify CI fix & CLAUDE.md tracking

### Fixed
- `fix(ci)`: remove `paths` filter from `formal-verify.yml` `pull_request` trigger — formal verification is a required branch protection check, so it must run on every PR regardless of which files changed

### Changed
- `chore`: track `CLAUDE.md` in git — release process docs, CI troubleshooting, and key commands are now available to all contributors and fresh clones

## [0.41.12] - 2026-04-06 — Skill distribution via installer

### Added
- `feat(install)`: distribute skills from `agents/skills/` to `~/.claude/skills/` during installation — currently installs `task-intake` skill

## [0.41.11] - 2026-04-06 — Multi-runtime installer & bug fixes

### Added
- `feat(install)`: support 9 new runtimes — kilo, cursor, windsurf, codex, copilot, antigravity, augment, trae, cline — each with `--{runtime}` flag, directory mapping, and config path
- `feat(install)`: defensive fallback for unknown runtimes in `getDirName()` (returns `.{runtime}` instead of crashing)
- `test(install)`: add smoke test for claude local skill distribution (`tests/bin/install-claude-skills.test.js`)

### Fixed
- `fix(gsd-tools)`: stdout truncation at 8KB when piped — `process.exit(0)` was called before `process.stdout.write()` buffer could flush; replaced with synchronous `fs.writeSync(1, data)` to guarantee full output
- `fix(install)`: resolve `binDir` reference error in CCR preset sync — use explicit `binDirResolved` fallback when `binDir` is undefined
- `fix(ci)`: add `npm ci || npm install` fallback to release.yml (test and publish jobs) — matches ci.yml resilience pattern; fixes 0.41.10 release pipeline failure
- `fix(test)`: isolate nf-stop quorum enforcement tests from project `.claude/nf.json` — pass `hookCwd` to `runHookWithEnv()` so `loadConfig()` reads from temp home instead of real project config

## [0.41.10] - 2026-04-06 — CI resilience & task-intake skill distribution

### Changed
- `fix(ci)`: workflow install steps now fall back to `npm install` when `npm ci` fails due to merge-ref lockfile drift — resolves persistent PR check failures
- `feat(skill)`: add task-intake skill distribution copy to `agents/skills/task-intake/SKILL.md`

## [0.41.8] - 2026-04-03 — Pure JS TUI & D→C FP Reduction

Deprecates blessed-xterm (native C++ node-pty dependency) in favor of pure JS blessed-terminal.cjs. Reduces D→C false positives with glob expansion, system tool allowlist, and design doc fuzzy rename detection.

### Changed
- `feat(tui)`: replace `blessed-xterm` + `node-pty` with pure JS `blessed-terminal.cjs` (`@xterm/headless` + `child_process.spawn`) — zero native dependencies, works on all platforms
- `feat(tui)`: remove 30-line node-pty auto-rebuild fallback from TUI boot

### Added
- `feat(solve)`: D→C glob pattern expansion — `seed_data/*.json` now resolves to matching files instead of being flagged as broken
- `feat(solve)`: system tool allowlist (40+ entries) — `nvidia-smi`, `docker`, `git`, etc. auto-suppressed from dependency checks
- `feat(solve)`: design doc fuzzy rename detection — files from `docs/plans/` with keyword-overlapping siblings are suppressed (catches `features.py` → `linucb.py` renames)

### Fixed
- `fix(test)`: ensure `~/.claude/` directory exists in `withNfJson` test helper — CI failure after node-pty removal (node-pty postinstall previously created this directory)

### Removed
- `blessed-xterm` dependency (v1.5.1)
- `node-pty` dependency (v1.1.0)
- `overrides.blessed-xterm` section from package.json
- `git-heatmap.json` from git tracking (gitignored — 138K+ line churn per solve run, still generated locally)

## [0.41.7] - 2026-04-02 — Solve Telemetry & Robustness

Comprehensive observability for the `/nf:solve` pipeline: per-layer timing, global deadline, session-aware token tracking, and convergence analysis tooling. Fixes diagnostic hang caused by unbounded test suite execution.

### Added
- `feat(solve)`: per-layer timing telemetry — 29 sweep calls timed with `Date.now()` deltas, `timing` object in JSON output with `{ layer_key: { duration_ms, skipped } }` and `total_diagnostic_ms`
- `feat(solve)`: diagnostic timing summary in solve-report (Step 6.3) — top-5 slowest layers, total wall-clock, skipped count
- `feat(solve)`: session-aware token tracking via `NF_SOLVE_SESSION_ID` env var propagated through Agent subprocesses
- `feat(solve)`: convergence timeline analysis tool (`bin/analyze-solve-convergence.cjs`) — sparklines, per-layer trends, requirement growth, timing bottlenecks
- `feat(solve)`: global deadline mechanism (`--global-timeout=<ms>`, default 180s) — wall-clock checks between sync operations prevent indefinite hangs
- `feat(solve)`: `--fast` default for initial diagnostic — skips T→C test execution and F→C formal verification layers, reducing diagnostic from ~30min to ~2.5s
- `feat(solve)`: `--full` flag to opt in to expensive T→C/F→C layers
- `feat(solve)`: `--no-timeout` flag to disable global deadline (for debugging/tests)

### Fixed
- `fix(resolve)`: use `nf-bin` path resolution for `solve-tui.cjs` instead of `PROJECT_ROOT` — fixes `/nf:resolve` failing in user projects where nForma bin/ tools aren't in the project directory

## [0.41.6] - 2026-04-02 — Quorum Infrastructure Overhaul & Project-Level Formal Specs

Major quorum infrastructure overhaul: HTTP API dispatch for claude-1..6, Option C file-based slot output, slot-worker hardening, truncation integrity pipeline, and file write reliability (25% → 100%). New project-level formal spec discovery with security-hardened execution.

### Added
- `feat(quick-365)`: truncation integrity pipeline — markers, metadata propagation, TLA+ model `NFOutputIntegrity.tla` with 6 invariants, nf-stop.js truncation awareness
- `feat(quick-366)`: `FLAG_TRUNCATED` verdict type — excluded from consensus when truncation caused verdict loss
- `feat(quick-368)`: 3-layer robust quorum fail-fast — idle timeout tuning, failure cooldowns, `--ensure-services` pre-flight
- `feat(quick-369)`: provider-level concurrency control — file-based semaphore limits Together.xyz to 3 concurrent HTTP requests, preventing rate-limit cascades
- `feat(quick-369)`: project-level formal spec discovery — `formal-scope-scan.cjs` discovers specs from `.planning/formal/specs/formal-checks.json` manifest, merges into model-registry view
- `feat(quick-369)`: structured command execution in `run-formal-check.cjs` — 3-gate security: command allowlist, dangerous arg pattern guard (`-e`/`-c`/`--eval`), path containment
- `feat(quorum)`: adaptive stall detection (30s timeout when < 500 bytes received) and early rate-limit detection (kills CLI after 2 consecutive retry messages)
- `feat(telemetry)`: `output_preview`, `output_length`, `exit_code` fields in quorum telemetry records
- `test`: 15 new tests for `formal-scope-scan.test.cjs` (manifest discovery, keyword/module matching, registry merge, E2E bug-mode)
- `test`: 12 new tests for `run-formal-check.test.cjs` (allowlist, arg guards, path traversal, pass/fail commands)

### Changed
- `fix(quorum)`: switch claude-1..6 from CCR subprocess to direct HTTP API dispatch — eliminates CCR overhead, adds HTTP-aware prompt adaptation for tool-less slots
- `fix(quorum)`: Option C file-based slot output — Node script writes result files directly via `--output-file`, removing Haiku from the critical path
- `fix(quorum)`: pre-built command agent — slot-worker runs one pre-formed Bash command (no YAML arg parsing)
- `fix(quorum)`: swap providers — AkashML→Together for claude-1/2, claude-5→GPT-OSS-120B, Gemini pro→flash (free tier quota)

### Fixed
- `fix(quorum)`: HTTP slot health check — skip layer1 binary probe for `type:http` slots, add layer2 API probe (0/6 → 6/6 HTTP slots available)
- `fix(quorum)`: bug-mode integration — `runBugModeMatching` now accepts preloaded registry parameter, merged project specs actually used in bug-mode matching
- `fix(quorum)`: prohibit background Bash in slot-worker agent — prevents file-write race from `run_in_background`
- `fix(quorum)`: early output-file PENDING marker — 3-state diagnostic (missing/PENDING/complete) for result file provenance
- `fix(quorum)`: defense-in-depth file write from `call-quorum-slot.cjs` child process — bypasses Haiku arg-stripping of `--output-file`
- `fix(quorum)`: context window pre-flight check + content-based STALL reclassification
- `fix(quorum)`: `FLAG_TRUNCATED` only when verdict was lost (not when it survived truncation)
- `fix(quorum)`: filter framework noise (hook logs) from valid-output detection
- `fix(quick-367)`: `findProjectRoot` honors `--cwd` argument; non-zero exit with valid output treated as available
- `fix(ci)`: add missing `latency_budget_ms` field to claude-5/claude-6 providers, update stale test expectations

## [0.41.5] - 2026-03-28 — Quorum Convergence Rewrite Restoration

Restores quorum convergence rewrite logic that was previously removed. When 3+ BLOCK verdicts accumulate, the workflow now triggers a fresh rewrite instead of continuing to iterate on a blocked approach.

### Fixed
- `fix(quick-364)`: restore `QUORUM_BLOCK_COUNT` tracking, accumulated block reasoning, and fresh-rewrite-after-3-BLOCKs convergence logic in `quick.md`

## [0.41.4] - 2026-03-27 — Loop 1 + Loop 2 Full Execution Path Coverage

Incremental on [0.41.3]. Wires debug routing (Loop 1) and formal simulation (Loop 2) into all default phase execution paths.

### Added
- `feat(quick-362)`: wire debug routing (Loop 1 + task classification + `debug_context` injection) into `execute-phase.md` — Step 1.5 classifies each plan via Haiku as bug_fix/feature/refactor, routes bug_fix plans through `/nf:debug` before executor spawn, injects `<debug_context>` block into executor prompt
- `feat(quick-363)`: push Loop 2 (`formal_coverage_auto_detection` + `solution-simulation-loop`) and `debug_context` passthrough into `execute-plan.md` Pattern A spawn prompt — nested child executors now inherit both verification loops

### Changed
- **Changelog rewrite** — all 0.41.x entries rewritten from git history; every `feat`/`fix`/`req` commit now has a corresponding entry with git prefix for traceability

### Coverage matrix

| Path | Loop 1 | Loop 2 |
|------|--------|--------|
| `quick.md` | Yes | Yes |
| `execute-phase.md` → Pattern A | Yes | Yes (new) |
| `execute-phase.md` → Pattern B | Yes | Yes |
| `execute-phase.md` → Pattern C | Yes | Yes |
| `execute-phase.md` → Pattern D | Yes | No (opt-in, deferred) |

## [0.41.3] - 2026-03-27 — Live Health Dashboard Fix

Incremental on [0.41.2]. Fixes TUI health dashboard that silently skipped all subprocess providers.

### Added
- `feat(agents)`: subprocess probing and `providers.json`-backed dashboard — TUI Live Health dashboard now probes subprocess providers via CLI `--version` checks and shows provider name + model from `providers.json`

### Fixed
- `fix(tui)`: remove duplicate `pdata` declaration in `checkHealthSingle` — eliminated early bail that blocked probing subprocess providers entirely

## [0.41.2] - 2026-03-27 — Enhanced Resolve Triage

Incremental on [0.41.1]. Overhauls `/nf:resolve` presentation with structured analysis and quorum integration.

### Added
- **Detailed resolve reports** — `/nf:resolve` now shows Key Files, Analysis, Pros & Cons, and Conclusion sections for every item type (solve items, pairings, orphan models, orphan requirements)
- **Clickable file paths** — all file references in resolve output use `file_path:line_number` format for direct navigation
- **Mandatory quorum action bar** — every resolve item and batch displays `[q] Quorum` option for multi-model consensus review
- **Batch action choices** — batch presentations include confirm-all, FP-all, and individual-item-by-number actions

### Changed
- **Resolve presentation format** — upgraded from simple verdict+recommendation to structured analysis with pros/cons trade-offs per action option
- **Orphan model context** — shows 15-20 lines of model file (up from 10-15) with module identification
- **Pairing analysis depth** — reads both model file and requirement text to assess semantic connection vs keyword overlap

### Fixed
- **Local patch drift** — synced enhanced resolve.md from nf-local-patches back to repo source
- `fix(ci)`: skip state-space guard for MCMCPEnv bounded model — individual step + master FV runner

## [0.41.1] - 2026-03-26 — Risk-Based Adaptive Quorum, Solve Reporting & Diagnostic Sweeps

Incremental on [0.41.0]. Adds risk-aware quorum sizing, expands diagnostic sweeps to 20 layers, and adds automation-first verification. Includes quick tasks 354-361.

### Added

#### Risk-Based Adaptive Quorum (quick-360)
- `feat(quick-360)`: add risk-based adaptive quorum fan-out with Haiku risk classifier — classifies tasks as low/medium/high risk based on file count, task type, requirements impact, and scope
- **Adaptive quorum fan-out** — Step 5.7 dispatches low=1 (skip quorum), medium=3, high=5 participants based on risk level
- **`--force-quorum` flag** — overrides low risk classification to medium, forcing external quorum dispatch
- **Quorum audit logging** — structured audit log emitted for every quorum reduction or skip with risk level, reason, and fan-out count
- **Risk guardrails** — ROADMAP, formal model, hook, and workflow files can never be classified as low risk
- **Scope contract risk fields** — `risk_level` and `risk_reason` persisted in scope-contract.json

#### Solve Pipeline Enhancements (quick-354 through quick-357)
- `feat(quick-354)`: add 5 missing layers to solve-report table renderer — full 20-layer coverage with checker alignment and signals fixes
- `feat(quick-355)`: auto-invoke `/nf:resolve` after solve finishes iterating
- `feat(quick-356)`: add 7 new sweep functions and fold 8 scripts into existing sweeps — wire 7 new sweeps into `computeResidual`, totals, table, `DEFAULT_WAVES`
- `feat(quick-357)`: add `@requirement` annotations to 8 domain-named test files + require-path tracing to `sweepTtoR` (TC-CODE-TRACE-8 test)

#### Formal & Discovery (quick-358, quick-359, quick-361)
- `feat(quick-358)`: extract unified graph search module and add graph-first discovery to `formal-scope-scan.cjs` — shared with `candidate-discovery.cjs`
- `feat(quick-359)`: allow `formal_artifacts: create` when scope-scan returns empty — enables new model bootstrapping
- **Automation-first verification** (quick-361) — verify-work and execute-phase workflows prefer Playwright/agent-browser over manual testing

### Changed
- **quorum-dispatch.md Section 3** — updated fan-out mapping: low=1/skip, medium=3, high=5 (previously low=2, high=MAX_QUORUM_SIZE)
- **Quorum timeout defaults** — increased from 30s to 300s for slot worker dispatch

### Fixed
- `fix(ci)`: allowlist quorum debate transcripts in gitleaks
- `fix(ci)`: fetch latest gitleaks version dynamically
- `fix(ci)`: use gitleaks-action v2 and unpin detect-secrets
- `fix(quick-354)`: revise plan to address checker alignment and signals issues
- `fix`: use portable nf-bin path in debug.md require() for lint-isolation
- **Orphan requirements** — triaged 48 orphan requirements across 6 category groups

## [0.41.0] - 2026-03-25 — Unified Autoresearch Execution Pipeline

Full milestone release building on [0.40.2]. Includes 4 milestone phases (50-53) and 17 quick tasks (337-353). Major themes: autoresearch-style iteration across all formal loops, solve pipeline optimization, debug unification, and `/nf:model-driven-fix` deprecation.

### Added — Milestone Phases

#### Phase 50: Debug Integration
- `feat(50-01)`: rewrite debug.md Steps A.5-A.8 to absorb model-driven-fix Phases 1-4
- `feat(50-02)`: wire constraint injection into quorum worker prompts and add formal model artifact tracking — constraints from Loop 1 injected as `[FORMAL CONSTRAINTS]` block

#### Phase 51: Task Classification & Debug Routing
- `feat(51-01)`: add task classification subagent to quick.md Step 2.7 — Haiku classifies tasks as bug_fix/feature/refactor with confidence scoring
- `feat(51-02)`: add debug routing (Step 5.8) and debug context to executor prompt — routes bug_fix tasks (confidence >= 0.7) through `/nf:debug` before executor
- **Classification persistence** — scope-contract.json extended with classification object (type, confidence, routed_through_debug)

#### Phase 52: Loop 2 Pre-Commit Simulation Gate
- `feat(phase-52)`: add Loop 2 pre-commit simulation gate to both executor workflows (GATE-01..04) — `simulateSolutionLoop` with `onTweakFix` fires before commit in quick.md and execute-phase.md
- **Fail-open/strict modes** — Loop 2 gate warns by default (fail-open), blocks with `--strict` flag

#### Phase 53: Skill Deprecation
- `feat(phase-53)`: replace model-driven-fix with deprecation shim (DEPR-01) — directs users to `/nf:debug`
- `feat(phase-53)`: rewire solve-remediate b_to_f layer to `/nf:debug` (DEPR-02)

### Added — Quick Tasks

#### Solve Loop Optimization (quick-337 through quick-346)

- `fix(quick-338)`: exit 0 on successful diagnostic, add `has_residual` JSON field
- `feat(quick-339)`: create `solve-inline-dispatch.cjs` for pre-running trivial layers without full Agent spawn + wire into solve orchestrator and remediation
- `feat(quick-340)`: conditional Haiku classification with 4 skip conditions — avoids redundant classify calls in solve-classify

## [0.39.0] - 2026-03-19 — Dual-Cycle Formal Reasoning & CI/CD Formalization

### Added
- **Dual-cycle formal reasoning** — Cycle 1 (diagnosis) + Cycle 2 (solution simulation) both iterate in model space before touching code
- **Prerelease pipeline** (`prerelease.yml`) — `v*-rc*` and `v*-next*` tags publish to npm `@next` dist-tag with provenance

- **Implicit FSM detection** — state machine detection integrated into solve-diagnose and close-formal-gaps

### Changed
- **CI workflow** — scoped to `main` only (removed `staging` branch triggers)
- **`@next` replaces `@staging`** — prerelease channel is now `npx @nforma.ai/nforma@next`

### Fixed
- **`release.yml` git tag creation** — added `git config user.email/name` before annotated tag step (fixes "Committer identity unknown" error)
- **QGSD → nForma rename** — replaced remaining `qgsd` references in active code/core with `nf`

### Removed
- **`staging-publish.yml`** — dead workflow retired (staging branch was 21 commits behind main)

## [0.37.2] - 2026-03-18 — Rebrand Polish & Changelog Backfill

### Fixed
- **GSD → nForma rename** in 8 workflow files — `/nf:update`, `/nf:help`, `/nf:quick`, `/nf:health`, `/nf:execute-phase`, `/nf:map-codebase`, `/nf:add-todo`, `/nf:set-profile` no longer reference "GSD" in user-facing text

### Added
- **Changelog backfill** — entries for v0.34.0 through v0.37.1 reconstructed from git history and release notes

## [0.37.1] - 2026-03-17 — Triage Fixes & Auto-Commit Formal Artifacts

### Fixed
- **#21**: `derived_from` array normalization in gate computation (fixes TypeError crash)

- **PROMO-04 verification** — session_id tracking for promotion audit trail

### Fixed
- Quorum consensus enforcement (Quick-269)

## [0.33.1] - 2026-03-10 — Solve/Resolve Data Disconnect Fix

### Fixed
- **Solve/resolve data disconnect** (Quick-257) — `/nf:resolve` now reads from the same solve-state and trend data that `/nf:solve` writes, eliminating stale or missing item references during guided triage

### Added
- **SOLVE-07 requirement** — Formal requirement for solve-to-resolve data consistency

## [0.33.0] - 2026-03-10 — Outer-Loop Convergence Guarantees

### Added
- **Gate stability module** — Flip-flop detection and cooldown enforcement prevent gate oscillation during promotion pipeline

## [0.32.1] - 2026-03-09 — nForma Branding & README Polish

### Changed
- **Terminal SVG rebrand** — Replaced QGSD ASCII art with nF pixel logo (salmon n + cyan F), updated tagline and help command
- **README improvements** — Quorum-reviewed (4/4 APPROVE): fixed milestone count (31→32), command count (30+→56), formal spec count (15+→18), git branch templates (gsd/→nf/), broadened audience framing, added prerequisites, removed redundant sections, added WSL2 note, linked formal CI workflow

### Fixed
- **Duplicate screenshot** — Removed duplicate `tui-solve.png` reference in Commands section
- **Stale color comments** — Fixed "Q in the nForma logo" → "n in the nForma logo" in SVG generator

## [0.32.0] - 2026-03-09 — Documentation & README Overhaul

### Added
- **TUI hierarchical requirements view** — Browse Reqs page now shows two-level hierarchy (principles → specifications) with principle-mapping module and groupByPrinciple
- **TUI configurable target path** — Target path selector with 53 unit tests
- **TUI Gate Scoring page** — Visualize per-model gate pass/fail in the Reqs module
- **Asset pipeline CI check** — `check-assets-stale.cjs` catches stale SVG assets in CI; integrated into both CI and release workflows
- **Solve sweep functions** — Export all 19 sweep functions from `nf-solve.cjs`
- **NAV-05 requirement** — New navigation requirement added

### Changed
- **README above-the-fold restructure** — TUI hero image, value props, comparison table, and metrics
- **README deep sections** — Expanded documentation for architecture, commands, and configuration
- **User Guide overhaul** — Getting Started walkthrough with embedded TUI screenshots
- **Asset output paths** — SVG generators now write to `docs/assets/` (was `assets/`); logo names rebranded from `gsd-` to `nf-`
- **Node engine floor** — Bumped to `>=18` with Node support table in README
- **VHS tape hardening** — Regenerated all 11 TUI screenshots with deterministic paths

### Fixed
- **TUI header gap calculation** — Target path line was hidden by line1 overflow
- **TUI auto-unfreeze** — Envelope unfreezes on Aggregate; Gate Scoring cwd fixed
- **TUI startup** — Removed OSC 11 probe leak; fixed startup via `nforma-cli`
- **CLI smart routing** — Installer on first run, TUI if already installed; `npx` routes to installer, global install routes to TUI
- **Gate A/B/C repairs** — Improved spec-module matching, fixed orphaned models, expanded failure mode catalog
- **Discord invite links** — Corrected to proper server URL
- **npm package** — Include `core/` in package (fixes ENOENT crash on install)

## [0.31.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Orphan PostToolUse hook from rebrand** — The rebrand (quick-186) renamed `qgsd-spec-regen.js` → `nf-spec-regen.js` but `OLD_HOOK_MAP` in the installer only covered 4 hook events (UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PreToolUse, SessionStart). The PostToolUse event was missed, so the orphan `qgsd-spec-regen.js` entry persisted in `~/.claude/settings.json` — pointing to a file that no longer exists. Added `PostToolUse: ['qgsd-spec-regen', 'qgsd-context-monitor']` to `OLD_HOOK_MAP` so future installs automatically clean up any remaining pre-rebrand PostToolUse hooks.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **BREAKING: checkpoint:human-verify quorum gate** — Auto-mode no longer auto-approves `checkpoint:human-verify` tasks. Instead, a quorum consensus gate requires 100% APPROVE from all available workers before proceeding. Falls back to user escalation on any BLOCK vote or quorum unavailability. Affects `core/workflows/execute-phase.md`, `agents/nf-executor.md`, `core/references/checkpoints.md`.
- **TLA+ state space reduced ~65,000x** — Converted `QGSDSessionPersistence.tla` from SUBSET-based to counter-based tracking; all 4 safety invariants and liveness property preserved (quick-235)
- **TLC metadir pinned** — Uses fixed `/tmp/tlc-metadir` to prevent 1.1TB state accumulation from per-run temp directories

### Added
- **Safety hooks hardening** — `nf-destructive-git-guard.js` emits `additionalContext` warnings; new `nf-mcp-dispatch-guard.js` warns on direct MCP calls violating R3.2 dispatch rules; `nf-executor.md` pre-flight checks PLAN.md existence (quick-233)
- **Per-model gate maturity scoring** — `bin/compute-per-model-gates.cjs` evaluates which gates (A/B/C) each formal model passes with auto-promotion from ADVISORY to SOFT_GATE; wired into `nf-solve.cjs` as informational sweep layer (quick-234)
- **Evidence-aware gate promotion** — Gate promotion considers evidence readiness scores (SOFT_GATE ≥1/5, HARD_GATE ≥3/5 evidence files); per-model gates runs as nonCritical step in `run-formal-verify` pipeline; `bin/refresh-evidence.cjs` runs 4 evidence generators before solve convergence (quick-236)
- **Quorum debate trace persistence** — `emitResultBlock` enriched with `matched_requirement_ids`; per-slot debate traces auto-persisted to `.planning/quorum/debates/` with full frontmatter; fail-open on write failures (quick-237)
- **Gate promotion feedback loops** — Always-on evidence refresh at session end via `nf-stop.js`; promotion/demotion changelog (`promotion-changelog.json`, 200-entry cap); automatic gate demotion with hysteresis (SOFT_GATE demotes at <0.8, HARD_GATE at <2.5); `bin/formalization-candidates.cjs` ranks uncovered files by churn × trace density; TUI shows recent gate changes color-coded (quick-238)
- **Install-time path validation** — `validateHookPaths()` scans installed hooks for broken `path.join(__dirname, ...)` references; prints WARNINGs with "did you mean 'nf-bin'?" hints; fail-open (quick-239)

### Fixed
- **31 broken hook path references** — All `bin/` → `nf-bin/` path mismatches in installed hooks resolved
- **Stop hook evidence refresh path** — Corrected `nf-bin` path (was `bin`) for `refresh-evidence.cjs` in `nf-stop.js` (quick-238)
- **TLC metadir wired into all invokers** — Remaining TLC runners now use fixed metadir consistently

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Update checker scope** — `nf-check-update` hook was still querying `@nforma.ai/nforma`; now correctly queries `@nforma.ai/nforma`

### Added
- **Memory staleness check** — Session-start hook warns about outdated MEMORY.md entries via `bin/validate-memory.cjs`
- **Invariant validator** — `bin/validate-invariant.cjs` classifies requirements as invariant/non-invariant
- **Close formal gaps command** — `/nf:close-formal-gaps` analyzes and closes formal model coverage gaps
- **Workflow improvements** — Invariant gate in `add-requirement`, `--strict` flag for `map-requirements`
- **20 new formal verification models** — 8 Alloy (architecture-registry, config-two-layer, mcp-detection, multi-slot, quorum-policy, schema-extensions, traceability-annotations, unified-check), 2 PRISM (deliberation-healing, observability-delivery), 10 TLA+ (activity tracking, agent provisioning, breaker state, config portability, dispatch pipeline, enforcement, installer idempotency, key management, prompt hook, setup wizard)
- **Publish script** — `scripts/publish.sh` reads NPM_TOKEN from `.env` for local publishing
- **CI/CD publishing** — GitHub Actions `publish.yml` triggers on release with OIDC provenance support

### Changed
- **Package size reduced 25%** — 606.7 kB → 453.0 kB via expanded `.npmignore` and `files` negation patterns
- **Package files reduced 35%** — 258 → 169 files; all 87 test files and 4 dev-only scripts excluded from tarball
- **Author updated** — `TÂCHES` → `nForma AI`
- **Stale peerDependency removed** — `get-shit-done-cc` no longer required (bundled in `core/`)
- **package-lock.json scope** — Cleared all `@langblaze.ai` references to `@nforma.ai`
- **Git remote** — Updated from `LangBlaze-AI/QGSD` to `nForma-AI/QGSD`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Circuit breaker hook** (`hooks/nf-circuit-breaker.js`) — PreToolUse hook that detects
  oscillation in git history (strict set equality across the last N commits) and persists
  breaker state to `.claude/circuit-breaker-state.json`; survives across tool calls
- **Enforcement blocking** — When the circuit breaker is active, any non-read-only Bash
  command is denied via `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision='deny'`; read-only commands
  (git log, git diff, grep, cat, ls, head, tail, find) always pass
- **Oscillation Resolution Mode** — Deny message renders the commit graph as a markdown table
  and explicitly invokes Oscillation Resolution Mode per R5 (CLAUDE.md); procedure detailed
  in `get-shit-done/workflows/oscillation-resolution-mode.md`
- **`circuit_breaker` config block** — `nf.json` extended with `circuit_breaker.oscillation_depth`
  (default: 3) and `circuit_breaker.commit_window` (default: 6); validated on load with
  stderr warnings for invalid values; two-layer merge (global + per-project) applies
- **`npx nforma --reset-breaker`** — CLI flag clears `.claude/circuit-breaker-state.json`
  (project-relative, resolved via git rev-parse) enabling manual recovery from deadlock
- **Installer auto-registers circuit breaker hook** — `npx nforma@latest` now writes a
  PreToolUse entry for `nf-circuit-breaker.js` in `~/.claude/settings.json` and writes
  the default `circuit_breaker` config block to `~/.claude/nf.json`; reinstall is
  idempotent (existing user values are never overwritten)
- **QGSD rebranding** — Package renamed to `qgsd`; banner updated to "QGSD: Quorum Gets Shit
  Done" with salmon Q; all commands use `/nf:` prefix; hooks updated to match both
  `/gsd:` and `/nf:` prefixes for backward compatibility (quick tasks 1, 8, 9, 10, 11)
- **Quorum agent scoring** (`R8`) — TP/TN/FP/FN weighted schema tracks each model's initial
  vote vs final consensus; scoreboard at `.planning/quorum-scoreboard.md`; Improvement
  Accepted/Rejected classifications track proposal quality (quick task 4)
- **`/nf:quorum-test` command** — Pre-flight validation collects artifacts before running
  quorum models; replaces human checkpoint:human-verify gates in plan templates (quick task 3, 5)
- **`/nf:debug` command** — Auto-proceeds when quorum reaches consensus; Step 7 executes
  consensus next step without user-permission gate (quick task 12)
- **`checkpoint:verify` flow in `/nf:execute-phase`** — Executor calls `/nf:quorum-test`
  at checkpoint:verify gates; enters 3-round debug loop on BLOCK/REVIEW-NEEDED; escalates
  to checkpoint:human-verify only after loop exhausts (quick task 6)
- **R3.6 Iterative Improvement Protocol** — When quorum approves but proposes improvements,
  Claude incorporates them and re-runs quorum; up to 10 iterations until no further
  improvements proposed (quick task 2)
- **User Guide updated** — Execution Wave Coordination diagram includes checkpoint:verify
  pipeline (quick task 7)
- **`--redetect-mcps` flag** — Re-runs MCP prefix detection and overwrites
  `~/.claude/nf.json` without a full reinstall

### Fixed
- **GUARD 5 delivery gaps** — `hooks/dist/` rebuilt to include Phase 4 GUARD 5 code
  (`hasArtifactCommit` + `hasDecisionMarker`); `buildQuorumInstructions()` in `bin/install.js`
  now appends the `<!-- GSD_DECISION -->` marker step so installer-written configs trigger
  `hasDecisionMarker()` correctly; `templates/nf.json` updated to match
- **Installer uninstall dead hook** (INST-08) — `uninstall()` now removes the PreToolUse
  circuit breaker hook entry from `~/.claude/settings.json`, mirroring the existing Stop
  and UserPromptSubmit removal pattern
- **`--reset-breaker` path resolution** (RECV-01) — Uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
  with `process.cwd()` fallback, consistent with how `nf-circuit-breaker.js` resolves
  the git root
- **Installer sub-key backfill** (INST-10) — Uses `=== undefined` check (not falsy) to
  preserve user-set values including `0`; `validateConfig()` handles runtime validation

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### nForma — Initial Release

QGSD adds multi-model quorum enforcement to GSD via Claude Code hooks. It installs
alongside GSD without modifying any GSD source files.

**GSD compatibility:** `get-shit-done-cc >= 1.20.0`

**Files installed into `~/.claude/` by nForma:**
- `hooks/nf-stop.js` — Stop hook: reads transcript JSONL, blocks if quorum evidence missing
- `hooks/nf-prompt.js` — UserPromptSubmit hook: injects quorum instructions before planning commands
- `hooks/config-loader.js` — Shared config loader: two-layer merge (global + per-project nf.json)
- `nf.json` — Quorum config with MCP-auto-detected tool prefixes

**SYNC-04 audit (no GSD source modifications):**
QGSD adds only the files listed above. Zero imports from GSD internals
(`get-shit-done/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `bin/`). GSD source is unmodified.

**SYNC-02 maintenance note:**
When GSD adds a new planning command, update `quorum_commands` in three places:
`hooks/config-loader.js` (DEFAULT_CONFIG), `bin/install.js` (qgsd config write block),
and `templates/nf.json`. Then cut a nForma patch release.

## [1.20.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- `/gsd:health --repair` now creates timestamped backup before regenerating STATE.md (#657)

### Changed
- Subagents now discover and load project CLAUDE.md and skills at spawn time for better project context (#671, #672)
- Improved context loading reliability in spawned agents

## [1.20.4] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Executor agents now update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md after each plan completes — previously both documents stayed unchecked throughout milestone execution
- New `requirements mark-complete` CLI command enables per-plan requirement tracking instead of waiting for phase completion
- Executor final commit includes ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md

## [1.20.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Milestone audit now cross-references three independent sources (VERIFICATION.md + SUMMARY frontmatter + REQUIREMENTS.md traceability) instead of single-source phase status checks
- Orphaned requirements (in traceability table but absent from all phase VERIFICATIONs) detected and forced to `unsatisfied`
- Integration checker receives milestone requirement IDs and maps findings to affected requirements
- `complete-milestone` gates on requirements completion before archival — surfaces unchecked requirements with proceed/audit/abort options
- `plan-milestone-gaps` updates REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (phase assignments, checkbox resets, coverage count) and includes it in commit
- Gemini CLI: escape `${VAR}` shell variables in agent bodies to prevent template validation failures

## [1.20.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Requirements tracking chain now strips bracket syntax (`[REQ-01, REQ-02]` → `REQ-01, REQ-02`) across all agents
- Verifier cross-references requirement IDs from PLAN frontmatter instead of only grepping REQUIREMENTS.md by phase number
- Orphaned requirements (mapped to phase in REQUIREMENTS.md but unclaimed by any plan) are detected and flagged

### Changed
- All `requirements` references across planner, templates, and workflows enforce MUST/REQUIRED/CRITICAL language — no more passive suggestions
- Plan checker now **fails** (blocking, not warning) when any roadmap requirement is absent from all plans
- Researcher receives phase-specific requirement IDs and must output a `<phase_requirements>` mapping table
- Phase requirement IDs extracted from ROADMAP and passed through full chain: researcher → planner → checker → executor → verifier
- Verification report requirements table expanded with Source Plan, Description, and Evidence columns

## [1.20.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Auto-mode (`--auto`) now survives context compaction by persisting `workflow.auto_advance` to config.json on disk
- Checkpoints no longer block auto-mode: human-verify auto-approves, decision auto-selects first option (human-action still stops for auth gates)
- Plan-phase now passes `--auto` flag when spawning execute-phase
- Auto-advance clears on milestone complete to prevent runaway chains

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- `/gsd:health` command — validates `.planning/` directory integrity with `--repair` flag for auto-fixing config.json and STATE.md
- `--full` flag for `/gsd:quick` — enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification on quick tasks
- `--auto` flag wired from `/gsd:new-project` through the full phase chain (discuss → plan → execute)
- Auto-advance chains phase execution across full milestones when `workflow.auto_advance` is enabled

### Fixed
- Plans created without user context — `/gsd:plan-phase` warns when no CONTEXT.md exists, `/gsd:discuss-phase` warns when plans already exist (#253)
- OpenCode installer converts `general-purpose` subagent type to OpenCode's `general`
- `/gsd:complete-milestone` respects `commit_docs` setting when merging branches
- Phase directories tracked in git via `.gitkeep` files

## [1.19.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- User-level default settings via `~/.gsd/defaults.json` — set GSD defaults across all projects
- Per-agent model overrides — customize which Claude model each agent uses

### Changed
- Completed milestone phase directories are now archived for cleaner project structure
- Wave execution diagram added to README for clearer parallelization visualization

### Fixed
- OpenCode local installs now write config to `./.opencode/` instead of overwriting global `~/.config/opencode/`
- Large JSON payloads write to temp files to prevent truncation in tool calls
- Phase heading matching now supports `####` depth
- Phase padding normalized in insert command
- ESM conflicts prevented by renaming gsd-tools.js to .cjs
- Config directory paths quoted in hook templates for local installs
- Settings file corruption prevented by using Write tool for file creation
- Plan-phase autocomplete fixed by removing "execution" from description
- Executor now has scope boundary and attempt limit to prevent runaway loops

## [1.19.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Auto-advance pipeline: `--auto` flag on `discuss-phase` and `plan-phase` chains discuss → plan → execute without stopping. Also available as `workflow.auto_advance` config setting

### Fixed
- Phase transition routing now routes to `discuss-phase` (not `plan-phase`) when no CONTEXT.md exists — consistent across all workflows (#530)
- ROADMAP progress table plan counts are now computed from disk instead of LLM-edited — deterministic "X/Y Complete" values (#537)
- Verifier uses ROADMAP Success Criteria directly instead of deriving verification truths from the Goal field (#538)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updates when a phase completes
- STATE.md updates after discuss-phase completes (#556)
- AskUserQuestion headers enforced to 12-char max to prevent UI truncation (#559)

- Windows: Replaced HEREDOC with literal newlines for git commit compatibility
- Research decision from `/gsd:new-milestone` now persists to config.json

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **gsd-tools verification suite**: `verify plan-structure`, `verify phase-completeness`, `verify references`, `verify commits`, `verify artifacts`, `verify key-links` — deterministic structural checks
- **gsd-tools frontmatter CRUD**: `frontmatter get/set/merge/validate` — safe YAML frontmatter operations with schema validation
- **gsd-tools template fill**: `template fill summary/plan/verification` — pre-filled document skeletons
- **gsd-tools state progression**: `state advance-plan`, `state update-progress`, `state record-metric`, `state add-decision`, `state add-blocker`, `state resolve-blocker`, `state record-session` — automates STATE.md updates
- **Local patch preservation**: Installer now detects locally modified GSD files, backs them up to `gsd-local-patches/`, and creates a manifest for restoration

### Changed
- Agents (executor, planner, plan-checker, verifier) now use gsd-tools for state updates and verification instead of manual markdown parsing
- `/gsd:update` workflow now notifies about backed-up local patches and suggests `/gsd:reapply-patches`

### Fixed
- Added workaround for Claude Code `classifyHandoffIfNeeded` bug that causes false agent failures — execute-phase and quick workflows now spot-check actual output before reporting failure

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- 10 new gsd-tools CLI commands that replace manual AI orchestration of mechanical operations:
  - `phase add <desc>` — append phase to roadmap + create directory
  - `phase insert <after> <desc>` — insert decimal phase
  - `phase remove <N> [--force]` — remove phase with full renumbering
  - `phase complete <N>` — mark done, update state + roadmap, detect milestone end
  - `roadmap analyze` — unified roadmap parser with disk status
  - `milestone complete <ver> [--name]` — archive roadmap/requirements/audit
  - `validate consistency` — check phase numbering and disk/roadmap sync
  - `progress [json|table|bar]` — render progress in various formats
  - `todo complete <file>` — move todo from pending to completed
  - `scaffold [context|uat|verification|phase-dir]` — template generation

### Changed
- Workflows now delegate deterministic operations to gsd-tools CLI, reducing token usage and errors:
  - `remove-phase.md`: 13 manual steps → 1 CLI call + confirm + commit
  - `add-phase.md`: 6 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `insert-phase.md`: 7 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `complete-milestone.md`: archival delegated to `milestone complete`
  - `progress.md`: roadmap parsing delegated to `roadmap analyze`

### Fixed
- Execute-phase now correctly spawns `gsd-executor` subagents instead of generic task agents
- `commit_docs=false` setting now respected in all `.planning/` commit paths (execute-plan, debugger, reference docs all route through gsd-tools CLI)
- Execute-phase orchestrator no longer bloats context by embedding file content — passes paths instead, letting subagents read in their fresh context
- Windows: Normalized backslash paths in gsd-tools invocations (contributed by @rmindel)

- `gsd-tools phase next-decimal` — Calculates next decimal phase number for insert operations
- `gsd-tools state get/patch` — Atomic STATE.md field operations
- `gsd-tools template select` — Chooses summary template based on plan complexity
- Summary template variants: minimal (~30 lines), standard (~60 lines), complex (~100 lines)
- Test infrastructure with 22 tests covering new commands

### Changed
- Planner uses two-step context assembly: digest for selection, full SUMMARY for understanding
- Agents migrated from bash patterns to structured gsd-tools commands
- Nested YAML frontmatter parsing now handles `dependency-graph.provides`, `tech-stack.added` correctly

## [1.12.1] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Consolidated workflow initialization into compound `init` commands, reducing token usage and improving startup performance
- Updated 24 workflow and agent files to use single-call context gathering instead of multiple atomic calls

- Explicit scope guardrail prevents scope creep during discussion — captures deferred ideas without acting on them
- CONTEXT.md template restructured for decisions (domain boundary, decisions by category, Claude's discretion, deferred ideas)
- Downstream awareness: discuss-phase now explicitly documents that CONTEXT.md feeds researcher and planner agents
- `/gsd:plan-phase` now integrates research — spawns `gsd-phase-researcher` before planning unless research exists or `--skip-research` flag used

### Changed
- README: Separated flow into distinct steps (1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) making `research-project` clearly optional and `define-requirements` required
- README: Research recommended for quality; skip only for speed

### Fixed
- execute-phase: Phase metadata (timing, wave info) now bundled into single commit instead of separate commits

## [1.5.5] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README now documents the `research-project` → `define-requirements` flow (optional but recommended before `create-roadmap`)
- Commands section reorganized into 7 grouped tables (Setup, Execution, Verification, Milestones, Phase Management, Session, Utilities) for easier scanning
- Context Engineering table now includes `research/` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`

## [1.5.4] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- Research phase now loads REQUIREMENTS.md to focus research on concrete requirements (e.g., "email verification") rather than just high-level roadmap descriptions

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **execute-phase narration**: Orchestrator now describes what each wave builds before spawning agents, and summarizes what was built after completion. No more staring at opaque status updates.
- **new-project flow**: Now offers two paths — research first (recommended) or define requirements directly (fast path for familiar domains)
- **define-requirements**: Works without prior research. Gathers requirements through conversation when FEATURES.md doesn't exist.

### Removed
- Dead `/gsd:status` command (referenced abandoned background agent model)
- Unused `agent-history.md` template
- `_archive/` directory with old execute-phase version

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- Requirements traceability: roadmap phases now include `Requirements:` field listing which REQ-IDs they cover
- plan-phase loads REQUIREMENTS.md and shows phase-specific requirements before planning
- Requirements automatically marked Complete when phase finishes

### Changed
- Workflow preferences (mode, depth, parallelization) now asked in single prompt instead of 3 separate questions
- define-requirements shows full requirements list inline before commit (not just counts)
- Research-project and workflow aligned to both point to define-requirements as next step

### Fixed
- Requirements status now updated by orchestrator (commands) instead of subagent workflow, which couldn't determine phase completion

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Research agents write their own files directly (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) instead of returning results to orchestrator
- Slimmed principles.md and load it dynamically in core commands

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/gsd:research-project` command for pre-roadmap ecosystem research — spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls before you commit to a roadmap
- New `/gsd:define-requirements` command for scoping v1 requirements from research findings — transforms "what exists in this domain" into "what we're building"
- Requirements traceability: phases now map to specific requirement IDs with 100% coverage validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** New project flow is now: `new-project → research-project → define-requirements → create-roadmap`
- Roadmap creation now requires REQUIREMENTS.md and validates all v1 requirements are mapped to phases
- Simplified questioning in new-project to four essentials (vision, core priority, boundaries, constraints)
